<p>The new research has shown that there is a consistent difference between the amount of alcohol and beer used by a group of
  soldiers. These differences could be attributed to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li> The number of days in the field; </li>
    <li> The number of slepping time each day; </li>
    <li> The difference between types of soldiers; </li>
    <li> Order and discipline.</li>
  </ul>

<p> From the research, we could conclude that a new approach has to be done to limit the amount of alcohol used by soldiers
  each day, including enhancing discipline, not reducing slepping time each day under 6 hours, and guarantee a comprehensive
  approach for the eating regime or each person.</p><br />
